Sod bootstraps a centos machine using a github repo that uses bundler.

You need two cookbooks, bootstrap and main.  Bootstrap should contain only what needs to happen before bundle install.
After bundle install the main cookbook will be run with bundle exec.  This one should set up everything else.

Both cookbooks need a default recipe
