Sod bootstraps a debian machine using a github repo that uses bundler.

You need one cookbook, with a bootstrap.rb and a default.rb

Bootstrap should contain only what needs to happen before bundle install.
After bundle install the default recipe will be run.  This one should set up everything else.

You configure all this with a Sodfile that looks like this:

production:
  key_location: chef/id_rsa
  ssh_config_location: chef/config
  user: root
  repo: git@github.com:mikesofaer/sod.git
  app_dir: /usr/local/app
  cookbook: sod
  test_suite_recipe: test_suite
